11,BAN BET: INFLATION REPORT ON SEPTEMBER 13 WILL CAUSE MARKET SELLOFF,"I tried warning you all multiple times. When I said CASH WAS KING in October 2021, nobody listened. But I was right. CASH and short term trading have been the clear winners in 2022.

Instead, 2022 has been a bloodbath for 99% of WSB. The same people who were making six figures in 2021 have now lost all their gains and then their life savings in 2022. The LOSS PORN has been most satisfying.

But wait! It will get worse from here if you don't pay attention.

OCTOBER 13

Inflation report for September will be dropped at 8:30am EST. Consensus is forecasting September inflation numbers to be 8.1% - 8.2%.

[Inflation is well above the Fed's target of 2&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/sdiimzpazdt91.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=699373f4a382acbaf35068ae8337bd8bb1e8fd2a)

IT WILL BE A BLOODBATH

Inflation will remain well elevated above the Fed's target range of 2%. The market will selloff aggressively as we start another leg lower.

Any hopes and pipe dreams for a ""FED PIVOT"" will be squashed tomorrow.

JPOW has repeated himself multiple times: ""THE FED WILL REMAIN HAWKISH AND NOT PIVOT ON MONETARY POLICY UNTIL INFLATION IS BACK DOWN TO OUR TARGET RANGE OF 2%.

[Inflation is going parabolic and it WILL come down, but not without causing PAIN](https://preview.redd.it/vxjnir0ozdt91.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b388de7000a577d8b913db0fae5cbeb4d86e2709)

The market has still not accepted the fact that the long term trend of the market is reversed. This will not be a situation like 2016, 2018 or 2020 or 2021 where bad news is quickly reversed and the bull gang is unleashed. 

This is more like the Nikkei of 1990.

[Foreshadowing](https://preview.redd.it/eajfbiymzdt91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=b39faaedf89d176ebfc6d8f8ae7318aabcbbfd12)

$SPY will touch it's February 19, 2020 high of $338/share by December 30, 2022. 

BAN BET: Inflation will remain elevated above 6% and the market will SELL OFF. $SPY will close down -1% or more on Thursday October 13.

This is a ban bet. If I am wrong the mods can ban me from WSB forever...or flair me with something awful if I win.

56,Thousands of federal officials own stock in regulated companies,"Thousands of federal government officials across the executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions made by their agencies, a Wall Street Journal investigation found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies that were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal, is said in an article published Oct. 11.

An official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its ‚Äúno-buy‚Äù list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a company before it won new business from the Pentagon, according to the report.

Title 18, section 208 of the U.S. Code, a criminal statute, prohibits employees in the executive branch from participating in a government matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on their financial interests, Federal Times has reported.

Such conflict-of-interests can include insider trading, a hot-button issue that the U.S. House of Representatives has grappled with in seeking to reform the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act.

The shortest bear market lasted just 33 days, in the spring of 2020.

Since 1928, the S&P 500 has experienced 21 bear markets (not including the current downturn). That's approximately one every 4.5 years, on average.

The average length of a bear market is 388 days.

Excluding the longest and shortest bear markets, the average length is around 330 days -- or just under one year.  
 The S&P 500 began its descent in early January, but it didn't officially enter a bear market until June 13, 2022 -- or 121 days ago, as of this writing. 

... I took 330 - 121 = 209 days left according to this article. Not associated with website.

Weakness in manufacturing and maintenance work in North Sea oil and gas fields contributed to a 0.3% fall in gross domestic product from July, and the report also showed how a jump in inflation was hitting consumers.

July's increase in output was revised down to 0.1% from a previous estimate of 0.2%, and in the three months to August GDP fell 0.3%, its first decline since early 2021 when the country was mired in the coronavirus crisis.

84,"Foreclosures are coming, now what?","It will take a couple of years until adjustable rate mortgages start, well, adjusting, and people will stop paying high interest on 50% underwater housing.

Since 2008 was not too long ago, being foreclosed on, or letting go of a house that is underwater is not a stigma or anything to be ashamed of, so people will be doing it at any hint that their neighbors are doing or planning on doing the same.

What does this mean? The banking sector will be under pressure yet again. The markets will be illiquid and will inevitably go down. It will take another 15 years to recover from the mess.

What does this mean for you financially? The best option in 2007/2008 was to be in cash, or go short financials, and then everything else. But timing a short position is tough so being in cash is probably better. The difference between then and now is that cash depreciates a lot more right now, so to keep up, you must earn some income on it to keep up with inflation.

Looking at dividend paying stocks in 2008, they crashed the least, and recovered the fastest. Say you want to invest in a sector that is a monopoly and has staying power, like telecom, then split your cash and dump it into a market capitalization weighted portfolio made of VZ, T, TMUS, LUMN, and FYBR, and sleep on it for the next 10 years. Then wake up and buy your neighbors house at 30% of what they paid for it in 2021. Lock in whatever 30 year rate you can, at that time. Go to sleep again.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",y1vble,21,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1vble/20221012_better_tasting_crayons_mathematically/

117,"10-11-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Just like that all the bullish momentum that SPY and markets gathered off the 356/357 support area was quickly washed away thanks to the BOE. Last week the BOE saved the markets this week they killed them. However, the markets STILL are not ready for the big one yet‚Ä¶ VIX still failing to hold over 34 and markets despite another 52 week low are holding for now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c0wzi1j7o8t91.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66cba949329bf0473f7357436dbaddb9a89efe9

The way I see it we just closed our 5th red day in a row. The VIX is magneted to 34 and cant quite break over it but cant quite hold under 33. Once CPI drops on Thursday we are either 1. About to start the 10-20% capitulation move JPM is calling for with VIX hitting 45-50 by next week and we see markets hit 300-320‚Ä¶ OR 2. CPI beats and takes all the tensions and fear out of the markets and we watch VIX break under 30 and SPY pushes back for 400+. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/92wb0ey7o8t91.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=524a0fbbe1e9e63d83f1440c3681ea2d06127a3a

Current black bear channel shows Thursday SPY can either hit 338 support (also the 2022 bear market support) or 370+. My vote remains 338 Thursday (depending on where spy closes tomorrow). 

This 4 day long red resistance line remains key in preventing us from breaking out. 357.3 remains resistance tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rpz7ssf8o8t91.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3a083e6fcbb6a0c8fa893ea53e89d0b8c0ab1f

Historically FOMC minute days are a red open followed by a smaller 0.5 +/- close. Occasionally we do close 1% though. Tomorrow FOMC minutes at 2pm will be interesting though because with how on edge markets are this could very well tip us over the edge. However, a good FOMC minutes where there isn‚Äôt too hawkish of news we haven‚Äôt heard of we could see a small relief rally. 

I would have liked to seen a green close today (and we were on path for it till the BOE news). I am bearish for this CPI believing that CORE is going to miss. However, I do not like the idea of buying puts after 6 red days in a row on SPY (assuming tomorrow is red too). 

Now of course we did just have September 20th to September 27th close 6 red days in a row so its not unexpected to see 6 red days and even a 7th if the news warrants it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aytabvx8o8t91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dcd53233bc62560c738f12b64f478368e116bea

Futures managed to hold that 3600 support line again today. Key support tomorrow is 3600 and key resistance is 3612. Tight levels but if futures can get through 3612 we just might see a green breakout day. However if we break through that 3600 level too much and start breaking under 3579 we might flush into CPI. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m4fczee9o8t91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdd483cca1839754b7f6bd4cbaf5e66fbcea8470

Surprisingly Apple held the red channel its been in for 2 weeks now. Key support remains 138.2 and key resistance remains at 139.6. Apple still has a gap to fill up at 145.22. 

If we see Apple break through and close under 138.1 tomorrow even if CPI beats we could end up seeing a bigger break down next week on Apple. Tech looked very heavy today. 

&#x200B;

Tesla continues to get absolutely crushed. It looked the strongest this morning with SPY was drilling and when apple was too. However, one SPY and Apple found support it seemed like Tesla had wasted all its momentum. We didn‚Äôt quite see that 213 support test today, however we did break the red resistance line that is 9 days old. This should provide some short term upward bull momentum for Tesla assuming Apple can hold support and SPY can breakout holding that 356 support. I would be surprised to see Tesla retest resistance 223 to 233.

Tesla remains to be the most volatile. I can see a case where if CPI breaks us down that Tesla could see 180s. However, with Tesla being so overdue for a bounce if CPI beats and markets rally we might finally see Tesla get back to the 250+ area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/um6a3ghao8t91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3ca31f2ac09f820526f5982943464e7d0fe54f

The VIX is telling us that the market is about unedge as it can be. With VIX refusing to break that support line today we are going to be looking at support of 34 tomorrow and possibly a high of 34.7 to 36.4 if FOMC minutes spikes the vix like usual. 

There is a chance we could see the VIX push up and that there is no relief with FOMC minutes‚Ä¶ this is setting the VIX up for 40+ CPI‚Ä¶ with the normal CPI being 15-20% we could see the VIX break 40 on Thursday if the VIX closes over 32-34. 

As I was saying I think we are setting up for a bigger dump on SPY. However, this has happened with previous CPIs too. However, this is about the most tense I have seen the markets. 

The most recent time I think the markets/ VIX have been this close to capitulation was May when the May 11th CPI hit the markets. We were looking for a CPI of 8.1 but got an actual CPI of 8.3. The VIX closed at 32.98 the day before CPI hit the markets. However, it opened at 32.87 reaching a max of 34.39 and a LOD of 30.69. SPY was also at the time sitting at its 52week low and on a massive drop leading up to it. 

So now why did SPY now dump through the abyss and why did the VIX not break over 40? Well its simple CORE CPI decrease from Aprils 6.2 to Mays 6.0. So at the time it appeared inflation was getting better. Also we obviously were in a much different time period, economic state, etc. etc. back then. 

So as I have been saying‚Ä¶. What is it going to take to put SPY in the 330s, VIX over 40 and send the markets crashing? (doing a bit of a CPI update/ play here since I will be gone tomorrow till next week and wont be able to update a post).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v743of1bo8t91.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=219b7809cb15c41b46049c3e91b507eaa0c0c6fb

Well if my math is correct and the historical trend of 0.2% +/- from consensus/ Cleveland fed holds true‚Ä¶ then best case scenario is 

CPI 7.9%, CPI CORE 6.3%, CPI MoM 0% per the consensus. 

CPI 8%, CPI CORE 6.4-6.5%, CPI MoM 0.1% per the Cleveland fed

And worst case scenario is 

CPI 8.3%, CPI CORE 6.7%, CPI MoM 0.4% per the consensus 

CPI 8.4%, CPI CORE 6.8%, CPI MoM 0.5% per the consensus

So as you can see we have in my opinion MAYBE one bullish scenario‚Ä¶ and that is that CPI, CORE CPI, and CPI MoM all beat consensus by the standard deviation of 0.2%. However, if you look at CORE last month it was 8.3%. Is no change in CPI CORE enough to take the fear out of the markets? Personally I don‚Äôt think it is‚Ä¶ CORE needs to come down especially after spending most of May to last month steady unchanged. And of course if the consensus/ Cleveland fed misses by the 0.2% then well brace for impact. 

Note- there was one time this year in February where there was a 0.3% variance. However most variances are a MAX 0.2%. Of course we have seen plenty of 0-0.1% variances which would all be bearish scenarios. 

With the BOE new hitting the wires today, CPI looming things could get really interesting here. 

10% challenge-

This has been a killer two days for me. I will not be trading the rest of the week (besides CPI play and maybe some longs after CPI). But I am going into a 3 day vaca with a 17 trade win streak and about $4600 in profits. Not too bad! Had a couple lottos I let run today which I don‚Äôt ever do. 

Note- I will NOT be trading Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. I will be away with family. Will check in briefly at times. I will post any trades or updates I see in the server for you guys. 

Note 2- there will be NO TA/ youtube posted Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. I will get a bigger Monday night update posted for you guys once im home and working. I will be trading full time starting Monday again. 

Tonights youtube video will be posted later tonight! 

Trade lightly these next 3 days with FOMC minutes and CPI with the VIX at 34 we are looking at some crazy volatility. We saw a massive $7 drop today like it was nothing. Anything can happen. Don‚Äôt over trade, trade smart, take profits whenever you can‚Ä¶ five 3-5% wins is better then a 10% loss. Be aggressive but smart. Get in and get out. DO NOT BE GREEDY OR FOMO!

158,Forexlive | The GBP is the strongest and the JPY is the weakest as the NA session begins,"Thought I will post for you guys a technical analysis for the major currencies which I have taken it from [forexlive.com](https://forexlive.com) . Hope its helpful

The GBP is the strongest and the JPY is the weakest as the NA session begins. The Bailey comments late yesterday that the bond buying would cease on Friday, hurt the GBP but it has since moved back higher today. However, it did little to stop the selloff in UK debt which has seen the 10 year rise around 12 basis points. The 30 year is up around 20 basis points. The GBPUSD stalled its downside move in the Asian session today at the 50% retracement target of 1.09242 ([see post here](https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/gbpusd-buyers-cant-get-above-the-upside-swing-level-20221011/)), and bounced back higher. As the NA session begins the pair was up retesting the falling 100 hour MA at 1.10909. Although higher, the GBPUSD at least is ping ponging from support to resistance and keeps the sellers in control.

For the JPY, the Asian traders took the USDJPY price above the intervention high from September at 145.90 and did not run into any intervention from the central bank. That has given the fundamental flows the go-ahead to push higher in the USDJPY with the high price (lower JPY) reaching to 146.625. Get disorderly, and the BOJ may still enter at any time, but they seem to be content with letting the cards fall where they may for now.

Today's action confirms the shift in sentiment. 

SPY stages a nearly 1.75% reversal in 2 hours. AAPL, MSFT and others all follow suit. 

&#x200B;

[SPY reversal ](https://preview.redd.it/j8h2bogye7t91.png?width=1873&format=png&auto=webp&s=cff7c339ceee1821fddf617e213575daf929966e)

TSLA breaks the reversal trend just moving sideways during the up moves of the market, and down on the down moves.

VIX collapsing. 2yr and 10yr rates falling. Crude is down. DXY is down. All of these are positive catalysts for growth stocks in the short term, but TSLA isn't following the trend. 

As I suggested on the previous post, if you haven't already now is the time to sell calls.

* Move comes a day after a sell-off in UK government bonds pushed up the country‚Äôs long-term borrowing costs

The Bank of England has widened its buying programme to include index-linked gilts in an effort to counter what it warned was ‚Äúdysfunction‚Äù in the market, a day after a sell-off in UK government bonds pushed up the country‚Äôs long-term borrowing costs.

In a statement on Tuesday, the BoE said the additional move would ‚Äúact as a further backstop to restore orderly market conditions by temporarily absorbing selling of index-linked gilts in excess of market intermediation capacity‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe beginning of this week has seen a further significant repricing of UK government debt, particularly index-linked gilts. Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‚Äòfire sale‚Äô dynamics, pose a material risk to UK financial stability,‚Äù the Bank said.

The BoE‚Äôs latest move follows Monday‚Äôs launch of a new short-term funding facility to avoid a ‚Äúcliff edge‚Äù when the central bank‚Äôs ¬£65bn emergency bond-buying programme ends this week.

The Bank also said it was prepared to step up the pace of purchases before its bond-buying programme expires to ¬£10bn per day, but bought just ¬£853mn on Monday.

The emergency bond-buying programme was put in place after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng‚Äôs ‚Äúmini‚Äù Budget on September 23 sparked a sell-off in UK government bonds.",y16air,37,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y16air/bank_of_england_widens_gilt_purchases_and_warns/

254,"The bullwhip effect, an early sign of recession?","The bullwhip effect refers to a phenomenon in the supply chain that describes how small fluctuations in consumer demand can create large fluctuations in wholesale demand and even larger fluctuations in manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials.

&#x200B;

Purchasing managers try to predict future trends based on past data to manage their supply chain. Last year we saw strong demand for the entire breadth of products, which contributed to the increase in prices (inflation). To meet demand this year, retail purchasing managers have increased their orders with manufacturers in anticipation of strong and sustained demand.

&#x200B;

The manufacturers, who also experienced strong demand, in turn increased the demands of the raw material suppliers. Thus, each part of the chain in turn increased orders to be ready with full inventory in anticipation of a period of strong consumption.

&#x200B;

With recent interest rate hikes and inflation hurting consumers' purchasing power, many have cut back on their spending and retailers have found themselves with excess merchandise and overstocked inventory.

&#x200B;

This is one of the most prominent problems in the latest earnings reports. Almost every company that owns inventory indicates that it is full and even if it has to be sold at decreasing prices, which may lead to a write-off in the books of the value of the inventory.

&#x200B;

The trend is starting to change, and purchasing managers are placing significantly smaller orders than the manufacturers were used to. If so, in addition to possible losses for the retailers, the producers and suppliers of the raw materials are also expected to be financially harmed.

&#x200B;

Analysts expect a final quarter in the US accompanied by large sales and discounts that will hurt retailers' margins, a decrease in demand among manufacturers in light of the large inventories, and even damage to the trade balance, which is expected to decrease thanks to a decrease in consumption.

&#x200B;

* ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future ‚Äî and this is serious stuff,‚Äù Dimon told CNBC‚Äôs Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday.
* His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday warned that a ‚Äúvery, very serious‚Äù mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the U.S. and global economy into recession by the middle of next year.

Dimon, chief executive of the largest bank in the U.S., said the U.S. economy was ‚Äúactually still doing well‚Äù at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared with the 2008 global financial crisis.

‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future ‚Äî and this is serious stuff,‚Äù Dimon told CNBC‚Äôs Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday at the JPM Techstars conference in London.

Among the indicators ringing alarm bells, Dimon cited the impact of runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative tightening and Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine.

‚ÄúThese are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world ‚Äî I mean, Europe is already in recession ‚Äî and they‚Äôre likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,‚Äù Dimon said.

Some U.S. investment funds rushed to snap up the bonds at what they considered incredible bargains.

‚ÄúIt was the heaviest selling pressure we‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù said Tom Majewski, a managing partner at Eagle Point Credit Management, a Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm specializing in CLOs. Eagle Point purchased about $80 million of CLO securities in the seven trading days ended Oct. 5, double the amount it would normally buy in a seven-day period, he said.

In recent weeks, trading of the CLO bonds most commonly held by pensions and insurers hit its highest level since March and April of 2020, according to analysis by The Wall Street Journal of trading data reported to a U.S. regulator. CLO prices stabilized last week after falling to their lowest level since mid-2020, but the selling continued unabated. Average daily trading in the first week of October was around $1 billion, twice the daily average over the past 12 months, according to analysis by the Journal.

The surge of activity took place while global markets‚Äîwith the exception of the U.K.‚Äîwere far calmer than at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The S&P 500 lost **7%** in the past three weeks, compared with 16% in March 2020.

Rising turmoil in CLOs shows how [fluctuations of normally placid interest rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/britains-financial-disaster-is-a-warning-to-the-world-11664596851?mod=article_inline) in developed economies are rattling financial markets in unexpected ways. Forced selling by U.K. investors has also hit corporate bonds, stocks, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, investors and analysts said.

CLOs are a sliver of assets held by U.K. pension funds that try to guard against changes in interest rates through so-called liability-driven investment strategies. Con Keating, head of research at Brighton Rock Group, said he estimated them to be a maximum of 5% of assets under management.

Pensions and others had invested ¬£1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion) in LDIs by 2021, data from trade group The Investment Association show. In the relatively small market for CLOs, sales a percentage of that size have the ability to shift prices, unlike in larger markets for government bonds and stocks.

Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts‚Äîa lucrative business for Wall Street‚Äîbecause the investment vehicles purchase about 60% of the loans backing the deals.

CLOs are investment vehicles primarily run by alternative-asset managers like [Blackstone](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BX) Inc. and [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG) Inc. The firms sell bonds and stocks to outside investors, then use the money to buy junk-rated corporate loans, which pay interest that is redistributed to holders of the CLO bonds and shares. Investors piled into CLOs over the past decade, [sparking worry of excessive risk taking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-engineering-made-risky-loans-seem-safe-now-they-face-a-huge-test-11584702000?mod=article_inline), but they held up in the 2020 market panic, [making them even more popular](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clos-wrap-up-record-year-11640637572?mod=article_inline).

Most CLOs issue bonds of different rank: Those with triple-A credit ratings get paid first, while junior bonds rated as low as double-B wait in line to receive payment. Insurers and pensions favor the higher-ranked CLO bonds because their credit ratings satisfy regulatory guidelines and because they pay higher yields than corporate and mortgage bonds with comparable investment-grade ratings.

Heavy selling of CLOs started the week ended Sept. 23, when the [pound hit a 37-year low](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-u-k-really-depend-on-the-kindness-of-strangers-11663851588?mod=article_inline), forcing U.K. investors that use derivatives to hedge foreign-exchange risk to sell assets to cover losses, said Wayne Dahl, a managing director at Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital. The deluge intensified the following week, when prices of U.K. government bonds tumbled, triggering margin calls on LDIs, held by pension funds.

‚ÄúThat generated a ton of emails internally,‚Äù Mr. Dahl said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve definitely been buyers.‚Äù

About $13 billion of investment-grade CLO bond trades were reported in the U.S. during the past three weeks, according to analysis by the Journal of a database maintained by Interactive Data Corp. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That is the highest volume since a three-week stretch in March and April 2020 when about $15 billion changed hands.

CLO prices have dropped to their lowest levels since May of 2020, according to an index of the securities operated by Palmer Square Capital Management. The firm‚Äôs investment-grade CLO bond index traded at 88.7 last week, down 4% since the start of September.

Some bond prices slipped even further, particularly those of European CLOs that were heavily owned by U.K. investors. The double-A-rated bond of a euro-denominated CLO managed by Investcorp Credit Management dropped about 5% in late September to roughly 90 cents on the dollar, according to data from KopenTech LLC. A spokeswoman for Investcorp declined to comment.

Falling CLO bond prices make it more expensive for CLO managers to borrow money to launch investment pools, reducing new issuance. Fewer new CLOs means fewer buyers for the ‚Äúleveraged loans‚Äù investment banks sell to help private-equity firms fund their takeovers at a time when debt investors are already worried about a potential recession.¬†

Banks that financed Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Management Corp.‚Äôs $16.5 billion buyout of Citrix Systems [took a roughly $500 million loss](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citrix-debt-deal-prices-with-large-losses-for-banks-11663769143?mod=article_inline) on related loans sold in September amid weak investor demand.¬†The market will face an even bigger test when banks [try to place $6.5 billion of loans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-revived-twitter-deal-could-saddle-banks-with-big-losses-11665069334?mod=article_inline) for Elon Musk‚Äôs planned $44 billion purchase of [Twitter](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TWTR) Inc.

‚ÄúFrom a CLO manager‚Äôs perspective, the selloff isn‚Äôt helpful,‚Äù said Lauren Basmadjian, a partner at the [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG), one of the world‚Äôs largest CLO operators. ‚ÄúWhat our market needs is stability to issue CLOs.‚Äù¬†

But Carlyle also invests in CLO bonds and from that standpoint, the forced selling by U.K. institutions is a windfall, Ms. Basmadjian said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve definitely been adding exposure over the last month.‚Äù",y15uqd,33,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y15uqd/uk_crisis_spills_into_us_junk_debt/

268,"Paypal stock falls after botched roll-out of an acceptable use policy that would have fined users $2,500. How did no one sanity-check this policy before it going live?","*  **PayPal stock fell 6% on Monday following the company's botched acceptable use policy update.**
* **The company faced backlash over the weekend after its updated policy included a $2,500 fine.** 
* **PayPal has since rolled back the update, saying that its misinformation policy was incorrect.**

PayPal stock fell as much as 6% on Monday after the company botched the roll-out of an acceptable use policy update that included big fines for the promotion of misinformation.

The new acceptable use policy expanded the company's list of prohibited activities on its platform to include ""the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content, or materials"" that ""promote misinformation.""

Users that violated the policy would have been subject to a $2,500 fine that PayPal would automatically debit from their account. The policy was originally slated to go into effect on November 3.

But the updated policy created a firestorm on social media over the weekend, with several former PayPal employees weighing in and criticizing the policy, including PayPal co-founder Elon Musk.

Former president of PayPal David Marcus tweeted, ""It's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But Paypal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.""

PayPal immediately rolled back its policy update to exclude the new misinformation policy. The company told media outlets: ""PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and the language was never intended to be inserted into our policy."" The payments platform said the policy update ""went out in error that included incorrect information.""

277,Energy is the only investment that matters in the next couple of years,"Stop pissing away money on daily/weekly options when you can make huge nearly guaranteed gains on oil companies if you can wait 6 to 12 months. Fuck it, buy options but buy 12 month options instead of short dated ones so the invest thesis can play out.  

We are in the early stages of a global energy crisis. ESG advocates have dissuaded oil, gas and coal companies from investing in capital expenditures over the past 5 or 6 years. We are reaching the point that we simply do not have enough energy to power the world at an affordable rate, so energy will become unaffordable. Oil, Gas and Coal companies will make so much money over the next couple years until voters realize how unbelievably stupid the ESG policies are and that they have decimated the standard of living in America.  

Oil price has been decreasing lately but this has been because of the actions of governments that are attempting to lower the cost of energy. Over the next couple of months the oil demand will increase by 1 to 2 million barrels per day at the same time that the supply will decrease by 3 to 4 million barrels per day, creating a net impact of 4 to 6 million barrels per day of tighter oil markets. This will probably result in the price of oil increasing to $150 to $200 over the next year despite a recession.  

* China and the US are both releasing approximately 1 million barrels per day from their SPR. US will likely stop releasing SPR oil after the election in November.  
* Once China ends their zero covid policy of locking down cities with covid outbreaks, Chinese demand for oil will increase 1 to 2 million barrels per day.  
* This winter, Russian supply of oil will decrease by 1 to 2 million barrels per day because Russia is not able to produce oil in Siberia during the winter without western oilfield service companies. These companies all pulled out of Russia due to the war in Ukraine.  

Only 18% of energy is used as electricity (most of which is generated with fossil fuels) and the other 82% is fossil fuels directly combusted for energy. So the vast majority of energy used is fossil fuels. The ESG crowd has convinced the world to stop investing in CapEx for fossil fuel companies because of the switch to wind and solar. There is no way to transition to wind and solar fast enough to avoid a massive energy crisis. Fossil fuels are required to mine the metals required to build the EVs, wind and solar. It will take way way way longer to make the transition compared to what the ESG crowd thinks. There is massive profit to be made from investing in these hated oil, coal and nat gas companies. Many of them have PE ratios that are 5 or lower at current prices, if oil price goes higher then they will only get better.  

Some of you might think that soon there will be peace in Russia and Ukraine and all of these energy issues will go away. The west recently destroyed Russia‚Äôs two nord stream pipeline and destroyed their bridge to Crimea. Russia is furious and just started a new offensive against 20 Ukrainian cities. This war isn‚Äôt ending any time soon.  

In the short run (6 to 18 months) the best investment is oil, nat gas and coal companies. In the longer term uranium miners will be the best investment. I won't go into the details on uranium and nuclear power investment thesis in this thread, but longer term it will be a tremendous investment.

First off, Solaredge with Optimizers provide the same panel-level production and monitoring visibility, along with other products like Tigo. Second, Enphase/microinverters are practically non-existent in commercial solar market as its simply not competitive in commercial/utility scale solar. Third, Enphase storage solution is not as good as Tesla PowerWall in terms of $/kWh, customization, and features, just slightly safer (but this is not even a concern with Tesla‚Äôs recent UL testing). The only reason Enphase storage is gaining market share recently is because of Tesla‚Äôs supply chain issues which will be resolved. I‚Äôm not a fan of Tesla or Elon, but facts are facts.
People say Enphase is the Apple of the solar industry, what are you smoking? As a solar industry professional, I can tell you this valuation is simply nuts and people don‚Äôt know this industry.
Finally, the biggest solar market in the US is CA. The Inflation Reduction Act restored the 30% ITC but the new impending NEM3 program in CA will rock the industry hard, soon.

294,Is something cooking at the AI driven lending platform Upstart $UPST!?!,"*Disclaimer: Seriously, nobody reads this anyways, so I don‚Äôt care. Infos are taken from the Internet, you can find them there too. Send me the authorities, at least then I will be protected from the shady guys that are after me, maybe‚Ä¶*

Good morning, I was looking at some very basic data of the AI driven lending platform **Upstart**.

I found some irregularities, which might be due to flawed data or something else. I don‚Äôt have the knowledge or ability to go further into detail, that‚Äôs up to someone with more wrinkles. I know most of you won¬¥t be nice or just comment stupid stuff so I would hereby like to insult you first!

For the ones that are *nice* and willing to talk seriously, *thank you* for stopping by and lets start:

Ticker: $UPST

Shares outstanding: 81.35 million

Public float: 68.88 million

% of float shorted: 35.34%

SI: 24.34 million as of 09/15/2022

Market Cap: $1.7 B

***


Current institutional ownership: [44.8%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/UPST/institutional-ownership/) *don‚Äôt ask me how this is working out with public float, just gathering data*

[Ownership](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/upst/ownership)

*Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST) is owned by 44.51% institutional shareholders, 60.77% Upstart Holdings insiders, and 0.00% retail investors*

**WTF** seems like **105.28%** of the company is owned by someone 

Largest shareholder are Daniel S. Loeb with 30.8 M shares and CO ‚Äì funder Dave Girouard with 17.6 M shares. Retail owns 0.00% (*yeah right*)

I added up all the listed institutional and insider holders and came up with 77.8 M shares owend (comparing all the numbers nothing adds up here, either data is flawed or something else is going on)

***


Consensus Analyst Price Target

High Prediction: $330

Average Prediction: $88.38

Low Prediction: $19

***


On Feb 15 2022 Upstart announced a share repurchase program amounting up to $400 million of common stock.

As of Aug 8 2022 they have repurchased 3.5 million shares totaling approximately $125 million

Which leaves them with $275 million for further buybacks (*speculation*they can use this to stabilize price against downward pressure, however if already 105% is owned, what are they buying?)

***


RegSHO

UPST is on RegSHO since Sept 02 2022 (26 trading days now)

***


**Max pain**: for Oct 21 2022 $40

 Dec 16 2022 $45

 Jan 20 2023 $60

It looks to me that options OI is not very high now, except for PUT walls at $22 this week, $22.5, $23, $25, $30, $35, and massive ones at $40 and $45 for Oct 21, $25 for November 18, and nothing really in December.

However, I would really wonder what would happen if someone came in and buy some leaps. Given that apparently 105% of the company is owned already, it is my firm believe that some interesting stuff could suddenly happen out of nowhere. On the other hand, this might also happen without you guys, I don‚Äôt care. 

***


For the üåàüêª who will come and say *nah, it¬¥s death* ‚Ä¶ I know, everything is death right now -> until it¬¥s not!

Just take a look at their [news releases](https://ir.upstart.com/news-and-events/news-releases), they have partnered with a credit union almost every month recently. 

***


**Conclusion**: I think this needs more digging. Either publicly available data is way off, or something is cooking here. I have no idea about financial stuff EPS, EBITDA so maybe someone could dig into that.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones believes the U.S. economy is either near or already in the middle of a recession as the Federal Reserve rushed to tamp down soaring inflation with aggressive rate hikes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether it started now or it started two months ago,‚Äù Jones said Monday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù when asked about recession risks. ‚ÄúWe always find out and we are always surprised at when recession officially starts, but I‚Äôm assuming we are going to go into one.‚Äù

The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of recessions, and uses multiple factors in making its determination. The NBER defines recession as ‚Äúa significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.‚Äù However, the bureau‚Äôs economists profess not even to use gross domestic product as a primary barometer.

# Fed Rate Hikes Are Pushing Credit Market Toward Dysfunction, Bank of America Says

* Credit stress is nearing ‚Äòcritical zone,‚Äô strategists say
* Fed needs to slow down hikes or face difficult fixes, they say

The  Federal Reserve needs to slow the pace of rate hikes to prevent credit  market dysfunction, warned Bank of America Corp. strategists.

Distress,  dispersion and debt-to-enterprise-value ratios were all above June  highs, pushing the bank‚Äôs measure of credit stress to a ‚Äúborderline  critical zone‚Äù this week, strategists Oleg Melentyev and Eric Yu said.¬†

&#x200B;

A  Fed slowdown and possible pause would ‚Äúallow the economy to fully  adjust to all the extreme tightening already implemented, but still  working its way through the financial system‚Äôs plumbing,‚Äù they wrote in a  note dated Friday. Failure to do so risks dysfunction that ‚Äúwould be  difficult to contain and fix.‚Äù

Leveraged  finance markets are reeling this week after the Fed‚Äôs latest rate hike  in its aggressive campaign to tame inflation. US junk bonds are headed  for worst year-to-date losses on record, while banks were forced to shelve a buyout deal in the leveraged loan market after struggling to attract demand from investors.¬†

Investors fled  risky assets over fears of a recession, pulling $3 billion from  high-yield bonds and $1.9 billion from leveraged loans in the week ended  Sept. 28, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.

Spreads  in the high-yield market could rise to around 600 to 650 basis points  if the Fed continues with its pace of rate hikes, said BofA. Average  high-yield spreads stand at 561 basis points on Friday, according to  Bloomberg data.",y0s6zr,102,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0s6zr/bofa_warns_fed_must_slow_down_now_or_risk/

369,'This is serious': JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warns U.S. could slip into recession in 6-9 months Do you think this is true?,"JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon (Jamie Dimon) warned Monday that a ""very, very serious"" variety of adverse factors could send the U.S. and global economies into recession by the middle of next year.

&#x200B;

Dimon, the chief executive of the largest U.S. bank, said the U.S. economy is ""still actually doing very well"" right now and that consumers could be in better shape compared to the global financial crisis of 2008.

&#x200B;

""But you can't talk about the economy without talking about the future - and that's a serious thing,"" Dimon told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum at the JPM Techstars conference in London on Monday.

&#x200B;

Among the indicators ringing alarm bells, Dimon cited the impact of runaway inflation, higher-than-expected interest rates, the unknown effects of quantitative tightening and Russia's war in Ukraine.

&#x200B;

""These are very, very serious things, and I think they could drive the United States and the world - I mean, Europe is already in recession - they could put the United States in some kind of recession in six to nine months,"" Dimon said.

&#x200B;

Last month, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in an interview with CNBC that he was concerned that the U.S. central bank was going too far, too fast, in dealing with high inflation.

The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point last month, the third consecutive increase of that size. Fed officials also said they will continue to raise rates well above the current range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent.

&#x200B;

""And, you know, from here on out, let's all wish him success and keep our fingers crossed that they manage to slow the economy down so that whatever it is, it's moderate - and it's possible,"" he added.

&#x200B;

Guessing is difficult, be prepared Damon said he couldn't be sure how long the U.S. recession might last, adding that market participants should evaluate a range of outcomes.

&#x200B;

""It could go from very mild to pretty tough, and a lot will depend on what happens in this war. So I think it's difficult to speculate and be prepared.""

&#x200B;

Dimon said one guarantee he can be sure of is market volatility. He also warned that this could coincide with disorderly financial conditions.

&#x200B;

Asked for his view on the outlook for the S&P 500, Dimon said there could be some changes in the benchmark index.

&#x200B;

""JPMorgan Chase is preparing itself for the fact that we will be very conservative with our balance sheet,"" Dimon said at the time. He advised investors to do the same.",y0x7k8,24,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0x7k8/this_is_serious_jpmorgans_jamie_dimon_warns_us/

*Via the FT:*  


Ben Bernanke, the former US Federal Reserve governor, has been awarded this year‚Äôs Nobel Prize in economics along with Douglas Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip Dybvig of Washington University, for their work on the role of banks in the economy and financial crises. The committee handing out the SKr10mn ($886,000) award ‚Äî officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ‚Äî said on Monday that the laureates‚Äô work, begun in the early 1980s, had ‚Äúimproved our ability to avoid both serious crises and expensive bailouts‚Äù.¬†The trio will share the prize equally. Bernanke, who oversaw the Fed‚Äôs response to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, was known for his analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s ‚Äî in which he showed that bank runs had been a decisive factor causing the crisis to be so deep and prolonged. Diamond and Dybvig had meanwhile demonstrated how banks performed crucial social functions as intermediaries between savers who wanted instant access to their money, and borrowers who needed to make long-term investments. They showed how this made banks vulnerable to rumours of their imminent collapse ‚Äî and how this vulnerability could be addressed through deposit insurance schemes and by governments acting as a lender of last resort.",y0etwc,292,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0etwc/bernanke_gets_nobel_prize_for_economics/

381,Is China Tech Doomed? (Part Three),"The U.S. announced new restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. The U.S. Department of Commerce also added 30 Chinese tech companies to the Unverified Trade List (UVL), which could lead to further export controls.

The latest export restrictions clearly target high end semiconductors, and support my view that China will lose the high tech war with the U.S.

‚ÄúThe export controls announced in the two rules today restrict the PRC‚Äôs ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors.‚Äù U.S. Department of Commerce

The U.S. government did not give a clear definition of ‚Äúadvanced semiconductors.‚Äù They likely include artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning and supercomputing chips at the advanced nodes.

‚ÄúFresh restrictions on exports of U.S. chip technology to Chinese companies have provoked an angry reaction from Beijing, but beyond the rhetoric, China is expected to unleash a new wave of funding to boost domestic production of semiconductors.‚Äù 

What rhetoric? There is absolutely nothing rhetorical about this. Both the U.S. and China mean business now. And the Tech War is fully on. It also doesn‚Äôt matter how much more money Beijing pours into semiconductors. Money is not the problem, as I said before. They key is whether China has the right system and people to create technology innovation.

Here is an important detail from yesterday‚Äôs press release, which most media overlooked.

‚ÄúRestricts the ability of U.S. persons to support the development, or production, of ICs at certain PRC-located semiconductor fabrication ‚Äòfacilities‚Äô without a license.‚Äù

Why is this important? There is a strong connection between advanced semiconductors in China and Chinese returnees from the U.S. I don‚Äôt know exactly how many engineers at Chinese semiconductor firms have a U.S. passport or green card. My guess is there are a lot, probably 10%, or maybe 20% of the core people that matter.

For example, Richard Chang the original founder of SMIC, is a U.S. citizen. He now runs SiEN Integrated Circuits in Qingdao, which began semiconductor production in August 2021. SMIC is the most advanced fab in China. Under the new rule, ‚ÄúRichard Changs‚Äù of the world cannot help China make the next leap in semiconductors.

TSMC: Last Ray of Hope for China

‚ÄúCommerce Department officials acknowledged that overseas cooperation is necessary to avoid hampering the initiatives and said there are talks with other parties underway around the world on the topic. The officials declined to characterize how advanced the negotiations are or how likely they are to result in similar actions in key countries, such as the Netherlands and Japan.‚Äù Bloomberg

It all comes down to TSMC, the top foundry in the world. Sure the U.S. continues tightening the screws on China. But the Chinese semiconductor industry will survive as long as TSMC continues to supply to China.

I had mentioned two important things last week that I wanted to watch. The red sideways channel from 362.8 to 378.2 and the red diamond support line at 362.8 Well we officially broke through both of those and now have a full candle closed below the daily 8ema. I think its fairly safe to say that markets are starting to realize once again the fed is not going to pivot and CPI is about to be a huge miss. 

361 looked like up until the last minute or so that it was going to hold. However with a failure to break a new LOY and that pretty impressive rally out of the 357s I am seeing some upside potential for tomorrow at least. With a hanging man candle closure on the daily we should look for a reversal up. I am looking for 362.8 resistance to be retested tomorrow. If bulls can retake that we should be looking for 366.7 to 370.7 as a closure. 

Historically FOMC minutes opens red and closes relatively fall (Wednesday) so from there we should see a fairly flat week going into CPI somewhere around that 366 to 373 range. 

Key support- 357.1 -> 352.4

Key resistance- 361 -> 362.8 -> 366.7 -> 370.5

&#x200B;

Futures showing the same breakdown as SPY today. Overall that doji candle closure after bouncing off key 3600 support should provide some upside relief tomorrow and possibly Wednesday before CPI. 

Key support- 3600 -> 3545

Key resistance- 3650 -> 3705 -> 3745

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mz6r6r9g1t91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfd9cd37ad0bdcd8248e38f20cea57e826791fb1

Apple held its red sideways channel today and actually managed to close out a green day. With the same doji formed on apple along with holding key 140 support I expect a push for the gap fill of 147.54 before CPI on Thursday. 

If we lose 138.2 at any point I would be pretty comfortable in some puts for a bigger breakdown and a test of Apples 52week low. 

Today for most of the day Apple looked very strong but was constantly being held down by SPY. 

Key support- 140 -> 138.2

Key resistance- 141.3 -> 142.5-> 144

Despite Tesla closing its 4th red day in a row, and 7th out of the last 8 trading days red‚Ä¶ I actually see a lot of strength in Tesla. I am seeing a nice 223 double bottom form on both the daily and weekly charts. Tesla with the doji I will be looking for that 8 day long red resistance line to be broken finally. That resistance lies at 221.3 tomorrow. Failure to break through that resistance would lead to downside and a bigger support test near 212.9.

I am bullish for tomorrow based on Apple and Tesla. I think we see a small relief bounce before CPI prints on Thursday. Key resistance of a break of the red channel lies at 240 on Wednesday. 

I also believe IF CPI does print badly that Tesla puts are going to be a great play. I believe looking at the weekly that tesla could see as low as 178 before next weeks earnings hit and likely boosts it back up. Of course a miss on tesla earnings and its gonna be really scary.

The VIX is very interesting to watch right now. Seemingly there was no major news that should have caused the vix to reach 34 today. However, once it did reach 34 we saw a pretty massive unwind of it there which saved SPY from a new 52week low.

I am curious if we are going to see the VIX sitting closer to 33 to 34 this time. The one thing that helps the VIX is that the FOMC minutes release the day before CPI and that should cause a nice unwinding of the VIX historically. 

However, I am seeing the ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù setup happening before our eyes‚Ä¶ As long as the VIX holds near 32-35 before market closes on Wednesday AND cpi is a huge miss we should see the VIX break 40+ on Thursday. 

Septembers CPI saw the VIX spike 15%... usually we see a 15-20% spike on the VIX, however, it often unwinds by EOD‚Ä¶ if we want to see the VIX break 40 we need to be at atleast 33-35 at market close on Wednesday night. 

Why is the VIX over 40 important? Well once we see that that is usually the sign of capitulation. Most people say VIX 40-60 is true capitulation signs.

Since I wont be here EOW to post any TA on this I wanted to add my weekly chart and what I am looking at. I am looking at SPY to most likely hold somewhere from 360-370 by Wednesday at market close. Assuming that CPI is a miss (which if you read my CPI post you see I am expecting this) and we are going to see VIX 40+ by EOW and I believe SPY could see 338 EOW. That‚Äôs about a 9% drop from 370‚Ä¶ If we get a CPI miss and don‚Äôt see 338 this week I believe we bounce near 328 to 335 the following week. 

10% challenge- 

Today was a pretty great day‚Ä¶ most of the gains came form the opening hour. Again price action is horrible to trade and we are seeing positions go green and then immediately rip red. This still remains a scalpers paradise and remains a quick and frequent profit market. This is not the market to be greedy in.

412,"Why you can make a killing on Activision Blizzard calls (or shares), even in this bear market","Let‚Äôs take a look at some facts here. 

Fact numero uno: Microsoft agreed to buy Activision Blizzard at 95 dollars a share. Fact numero dos: Activision is currently trading at $73.7 at the time of writing this post. Which I think has more to do with the current economic climate, and not a sign that the market thinks the deal won‚Äôt go through. Fact numero tres: The deal needs to be approved by the FTC and the EU, the FTC stands to either approve or deny the application by the end of November of this year. The EU stands to either approve the deal or launch a four-month long investigation into it by November 8th. I think even if they end up launching the investigation, they‚Äôll ultimately end up approving it. The deal also needs to be approved by the UK‚Äôs CMA by March 2023, although they‚Äôll go the way of the FTC and the EU. Fact numero cuatro: The deal will (probably), be approved by both the FTC and the EU, because by not approving it, they‚Äôre sending the message that they‚Äôre protecting Sony‚Äôs interests, instead of promoting healthy competition in the gaming world. Fact numero cinco: the deal has already been approved by Saudi Arabia and Brazil‚Äôs competition authority, SG-CADE. Brazil said this about the deal, ‚ÄúThe main objective of CADE is to protect competition in Brazil and the welfare of Brazilian consumers, not the private interests of specific competitors.‚Äù (i.e Sony.) A brief summary of their ruling translated to English: https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/642/2022/10/Decision-on-Microsoft-Activision-acquisition-from-CADE.pdf  
In essence, they‚Äôre saying it would in fact be anti-competitive to not approve the deal. By approving the deal they‚Äôre bolstering Xbox‚Äôs competitiveness, which will force Playstation to up their game or risk losing customers, thus ensuring gamers on both sides prosper. 

One of the FTC‚Äôs and EU‚Äôs concerns is that major franchises like Call of Duty will be made exclusive on Xbox and thus prevent Playstation players from accessing it. Let me tell you why that won‚Äôt happen. First of all, Microsoft doesn‚Äôt want to make Call of Duty exclusive, they only really bought Activision to bolster their game pass catalog, and attract more customers to the Xbox. Also, to enter the mobile gaming space via King Digital Entertainment, which Activision owns. Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt make massive games like Call of Duty exclusive, since doing so would mean they lose out on significant revenue. Microsoft has already provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee the same day release of Call of Duty games on Playstation and Xbox for at least three more years. Which they even stated, ‚Äúgoes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements."" My guess is extending this agreement beyond the three years will be one of the concessions Microsoft will have to make to the FTC to get it approved. Sony of course still has a vested interest in getting the deal blocked. Why do they want to block it? Because they know this deal will make Microsoft a significantly more powerful competitor in the gaming world and cut into their revenues. They can‚Äôt have Microsoft do this and so Jim Ryan (Playstation‚Äôs CEO), will go to anyone who will listen and complain about ‚Äúprotecting the consumer,‚Äù which really means protecting Playstation. Brazil already saw through this, and I expect the FTC and EU to do the same. 

When Activision does get bought by Microsoft in mid 2023, you stand to make 23% on shares alone. That‚Äôs pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. But if you‚Äôre like me and want a little more bang for your buck, you could buy calls and make a bit more than 23%. Currently, I hold 12.6k in 90 strike calls, January 2024. Which has 4.6k open interest, mind you, which means I‚Äôm not the only regard buying these, just one of several. If the FTC approves it by the end of November, I stand to make about 20k if the price goes to 85. The FTC approving it, would make the acquisition pretty much a done deal, since I doubt the EU will find just cause to reject it, after three major regulatory bodies have approved it. It‚Äôs just not a deal that will stifle competition but in fact will encourage it. Just remember if you do buy calls, to sell them before the deal closes in mid 2023.

Bear case: The deal is in fact rejected by the FTC (doubtful, since Microsoft‚Äôs two main competitors in this space are Japanese companies), and by the EU (could *maybe* happen, they seem to have gotten tougher on big business over the past decade.) Microsoft could also end up getting cold feet and backing out of the deal, √† la Elon Musk, although this is the most unlikely scenario of them all. They‚Äôve signed a contract already, and I don‚Äôt see them backing out of it, no matter the current economic climate. 

TL;DR: Activision will be bought by Microsoft at 95 dollars a share in mid 2023, after the FTC and EU approve it. You can stand to make 23% on shares alone or calls if you have big cojones. 

So that‚Äôs it, place your bets or don‚Äôt, and may the regardest regard win. Positions: https://imgur.com/a/4T23moq (free blowie if you can guess what broker I‚Äôm using.)

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",y0u7z3,18,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0u7z3/20221011_better_tasting_crayons_mathematically/

**Cost to borrow:** Annual fee paid to borrow shares and use those shares to short the stock. The fee that the borrowers are paying are approximately 20%. For well over a year its been approximately 0.5-1%. 

Between the bounces of $50-$30 last year the cost to borrow was approx 1% which is $0.30-$0.50 per share. Currently we have 100% utilization since February. The current price is approx $6, 20% of $6 is $1.20 per share to borrow for a year in comparison to the 30-50 cents they paid last year. 

Short sellers renewing positions need to borrow at higher rates.

When a stock tanks and hits its low, in the brains of many WSBers... the stock is done. Why buy? 

Yet that should be the opposite mentality people have. AMC hasn't had any bad news for it to come this low, so the price action seems mostly short and not fundamental. What does a short seller do when a stock hits its low? Same thing a long investor does when it peaks. **CLOSE POSITION**

**How do short sellers make money?** 

They make money in two ways, first is by closing position at it's lowest point and second would be by synthetic shorting via options and selling OTM calls to do so. The problem here is the cost to borrow is getting expensive. synthetic shorting seems to be hitting a wall with the price not getting lower, the IV is low as hell so they arent profiting. Sooner, rather then later... the stock might have no where else to go but go up.

Now here's the thing... if it goes up from here, options are dirt cheap to exercise. Comparable to $50 \[$5,000\] per contract to exercise... it only costs approx $600 to exercise. If this thing were to rip, things could get crazy quick, exercising is cheapest its been in a LONG time.

This is why I am bullish on $AMC.

I am also bullish on $GME. Take a look at the DTC/SIR \[over 15\] and SI at 20%.",y1ka6s,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1ka6s/why_is_amc_prime_to_go/

436,"NZD/USD recovers few pips from its lowest level since March 2020, lacks follow-through"," NZD/USD is seeing a slight recovery from the lowest level since March 2020 and is climbing to the upper end of its daily range, at the 0.5575 area during the first half of the European session.  
 

The US dollar leaves its intraday value at a 1.5 week high and appears to be the main factor providing some support to the NZD/USD pair. Without the necessary new stimulus, the downside of the USD can be attributed to some gains and should continue to be limited amid expectations of a hawkish Fed.  
 

Market participants seem confident that the US central bank will stick to its aggressive path of raising rates to curb inflation and predict another upward 75bps hike in November. U.S. officials backed those bets on Friday with a laugh-out-loud statement from Fed Chairman Lael Brainard.  
 

Brainard reiterated the Fed's commitment to reduce inflation and said the central bank will continue to raise rates in the short term. This, in turn, causes another rise in the investment of the US Treasury and brings the 10-year benchmark of the US government closer to the threshold of 4.0%, which should act as a tailwind for the dollar.  
 

Other than that, the developing risk environment can prevent a break for the dollar as a safe haven and save any recovery efforts for the risk-averse kiwi. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance in NZD/USD is at the bottom and anything further ahead can still be seen as a selling opportunity.  
 

In the absence of any significant economic releases from the US, traders will take inspiration from the FOMC's influential comments on Tuesday. This, along with US bond yields and greater risk-on sentiment in markets, could boost demand for the USD and give some NZD/USD a boost ahead of Wednesday's FOMC minutes.",y15byy,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y15byy/nzdusd_recovers_few_pips_from_its_lowest_level/

 Rivian shares sharply dropped Monday after the electric vehicle maker said it was acting with ""urgency"" in voluntarily recalling thousands of vehicles over a possible steering-related hazard.¬†

The company late Friday recalled 13,000 of its vehicles after a structural manufacturing error was discovered in seven cars.

The company's stock fell as much as 11% to $33.30 in premarket trading before paring the loss to 7%. The shares this year have tumbled by about 67%.¬†

473,"Cathie Wood issues open letter to the Fed, saying it is risking an economic ‚Äòbust‚Äô","The Fed likely is making a mistake in its hardline stance against inflation because it is looking backwards, Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood said Monday.

In an open letter, Wood suggested the Fed ‚Äúhas shocked not just the US but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust.‚Äù

The Federal Reserve likely is making a mistake in its hardline stance against inflation Ark Investment Management‚Äôs Cathie Wood said Monday in an open letter to the central bank.

Instead of looking at employment and price indexes from previous months, Wood said the Fed should be taking lessons from commodity prices that indicate the biggest economic risk going forward is deflation, not inflation.

‚ÄúThe Fed seems focused on two variables that, in our view, are lagging indicators ‚Äì‚Äì downstream inflation and employment ‚Äì‚Äìboth of which have been sending conflicting signals and should be calling into question the Fed‚Äôs unanimous call for higher interest rates,‚Äù Wood said in the letter posted on the firm‚Äôs site.

Specifically, the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indexes both showed inflation running high. Headline CPI rose 0.1% in August and was up 8.3% year over year, while headline PCE accelerated 0.3% and 6.2% respectively. Both readings were even higher excluding food and energy, which saw large price drops over the summer.

On employment, payroll growth has decelerated but remains strong, with job gains totaling 263,000 in September as the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%.

But Wood, whose firm manages some $14.4 billion in client money across a family of active ETFs, said falling prices for items such as lumber, copper and housing are telling a different story.

**Worries over a ‚Äòdeflationary bust‚Äô**

The Fed has approved three consecutive interest rate increases of 0.75 percentage point, mostly by unanimous vote, and is expected to OK a fourth when it meets again Nov. 1-2.

‚ÄúUnanimous? Really?‚Äù Wood wrote. ‚ÄúCould it be that the unprecedented 13-fold increase in interest rates during the last six months‚Äì‚Äìlikely 16-fold come November 2‚Äì‚Äìhas shocked not just the US but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust?‚Äù

Inflation is bad for the economy because it raises the cost of living and depresses consumer spending; deflation is a converse risk that reflects tumbling demand and is associated with steep economic downturns.

**To be sure, the Fed is hardly alone in raising rates.**

Nearly 40 central banks around the world approved increases during September, and the markets have largely expected all the Fed‚Äôs moves.

However, criticism has emerged recently that the Fed could be going too far and is at risk of pulling the economy into an unnecessary recession.

‚ÄúWithout question, food and energy prices are important, but we do not believe that the Fed should be fighting and exacerbating the global pain associated with a supply shock to agriculture and energy commodities caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine,‚Äù Wood wrote.

The Fed is expected to follow the November hike with another 0.5 percentage point move in December, then another 0.25 percentage point move early in 2023.

One area of the market known as overnight indexed swaps is pricing two rate cuts by the end of 2023, according to Morgan Stanley.

474,"Robinhood, the SEC and the whole government is a joke","I just finished watching the Netflix documentary on the $GME boom (I can still remember a part of it) but I didn't knew what was going on with Roaring Kitty and Robinhood etc... I remember people posting about something that Robinhood shut down the buy button on $GME but at that time, I didn't no what it meant or what it would cause. A couple of months ago I read a book about times where the gold standard was still the main economic system (btw it was really good) however, I've never been a huge fan of regulated markets, I understand that the SEC shuts down the market, if it crashes more than 20% a day and stuff, so black Monday can't happen again. But fr in my opinion no one, I don't care if it's f\*cking Robinhood, the SEC or the f\*cking president of the USA, no one should be able to make that call on shutting down the market or regulate stuff. I don't think that there shouldn't be any laws though, it's okay that pump and dump is illegal, the government can bust these people I don't give a f\*ck, but if the market is dumping 20% a day there's a  reason for that and they shouldn't just be able to ""shut it down"". Btw f\*ck you Robinhood, you were responsible one of the greatest market manipulations in the history of the US market, by shutting down that buy button! According to sources like theprotocol.com Robinhood got sued but they won the lawsuit (link: [https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit)). It makes me question how they were able to win a lawsuit, because to me there was no doubt, it was market manipulation. For real this stuff is a joke, the SEC is busting Elon (link: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226)) for some shit-posts he does on twitter but they don't bust Robinhood for refusing investors to buy a stock (which of course lead to a downtrend in that particular stock).

With the stock at -33% and a solid 2.75% yield, I'm thinking about a long position here.

Here's a deeper dive into Home depot (Fundies analysis)

Intro:

There management looks like they have an average tenure of two and a half years.They operate as a home improvement retailer and sell there products on websites

It has a relatively Wide economic moat when you look at it from the following perspective (Grading system 1-5 points):

1. Intangible assets: 5
2. Cost advantage: 5
3. Efficient scale: 4
4. Network effect 3
5. Switching cost: 2

The rating is subjective and based on my understanding of the company

The size of the company creates a **significant bargaining power** with vendors, and  other things, increasing  its cost advantage, which then passes a part of the savings to the customers in the form of everyday low pricing, which in turn, increases customer loyalty.

&#x200B;

From a performance perspective, the following metrics have been consistently growing YOY over the past 5 years:

1. Revenue
2. Net income
3. Cashflow from operating activities
4. Free cashflow positive
5. Gross margin %
6. EPS

&#x200B;

Other metrics:

1. Return on assets \~20%
2. Debt to EBITA \~ 1.77

Some downsides:There ROE is at 1.4K skewed by the **high level of debt**

More investigation should be performed regarding the very high ROE and possibly debt

Given the currently high net-debt to equity ration, and the fact that the ratio has increased over the past 5 years, the debt should be monitored and I will give a margin of safety of 25-30%  so I will only purchase the stock when it is trading below the $180 range.",y0rj41,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0rj41/going_long_on_hd/

498,All aboard the Pain Train! This bear market is just starting.,"Make sure you have a very good plan if your playing calls the next couple of weeks.  I think we'll see the recession earnings is just starting to hit home.   


Since my last DD on why I'm betting against the auto lenders is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwk71i/its\_earnings\_session\_my\_options\_plays\_and\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwk71i/its_earnings_session_my_options_plays_and_why/)  


Since then the articles showing up the inflation and risks to the banks have gone up.  An increase in debt levels proceeds a crash.  People want to buy themselves out of pain first.  It's why debt levels are going up.  As inflation continues to force people to reallocate to their basic needs, you'll see defaults on debt explode.

An interesting nugget I found is the that Zimbabwe is now demanding royalties be paid in actually mined metals and gems.  This is interesting as they seem to be worried about the financial system and want to hold risk free assets.

This shows the fear of liabilities in the market is real.  My focus right now is on where consumer default levels are.  I think if the Fed continues to raise rates the mortgage and the auto loans will default massively.

I think we are only starting this bear market.  That if inflation continues to hold about 7% and interest rates rise, we'll see disposable income plummet.  This will shift all income into critical needs such as food, shelter, and energy.  People will go all 2008 on their loans.  I'm very short on the banks for the next year at least.   


I would love to hear some people's opinions on if they feel I have missed anything.

I did some research but can't seem to find DXY replaying in the past on 1minute chart (for the past 12 months). I've used tradingview replay option but it didn't satisfied my needs because it doesn't have enough depth of real time trading and cant perform on 1min chart in past except the near term. If you know maybe if there is Youtube chanel or any other chanel, blog, etc. that posts trading DXY in the past it would be helpful.

What I'm targeting here is actually reaction off DXY due to CPI data release news. So I'm basically looking for movements at particularly date and time (for example 06/10., 05/11, 04/12 at 8:30 EST and so on.)

500,"Redfin - It's a data company, not a real estate company","The problem with this stock is that people just see mortgage rates above 7% and immediate dismiss it. They see how Zillow fucked up overbidding on those houses and immediately associate all real estate stocks with it. Redfin is much more than that. It's a data company.

https://preview.redd.it/oi6jw8aps0t91.jpg?width=1558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0804a2e6c0696d52583a49f7c2d4395836bc7aa8

At a time where monthly active users are leveling off or decreasing for the big social media companies, Redfin's has been steadily increasing. As you know, these big tech companies make a bulk of their money from advertising. This is Redfin's biggest value proposition.

The bad: Redfin has $462 million in short-term assets on hand, but close to $1.7 billion in debt. Not a great position to be in, but with their market cap trading at the same value as their assets, this is a great risk to reward play.

The short squeeze (\~14%) has more potential here than BBBY because Redfin is an industry leader, not a store in a sea of retailers.

At 95% down from all time highs, the only way to go is up.

Position: 8500 shares @ $4.90

514,Global margin call hits European debt markets,"Hedges blow up after risk gauges in Germany‚Äôs government debt market exceeded those of the 2008 world crash

¬†‚Äì Risk gauges in Germany‚Äôs government debt market rose last week to levels higher than recorded in the 2008 world financial crash, as margin calls forced the liquidation of derivatives positions held by banks, insurers and pension funds.

Big institutional investors that spent the past ten years insuring their portfolios against falling interest rates now face massive losses as hedges blow up. A key measure of market risk, the spread between German government bonds (Bunds) and interest rate swap agreements jumped above the previous record set in 2008.

The cost of hedging German government debt with interest-rate options, or option-implied volatility, meanwhile rose to the highest level on record.

The blowout in the euro derivatives market follows a near-collapse of the British government debt, or gilts, market, averted at the last minute by a 50 billion pound bond-buying spree by the Bank of England.

The world‚Äôs central banks responded to the 2008 world financial crash and the European financial crisis of 2011 by pushing bond yields down.

‚ÄúReal‚Äù yields, namely the yield on inflation-indexed government bonds, went deeply into negative numbers in Germany and the UK, followed by the US market. That pulled the rug from under insurance companies and pension funds, which invest pension payments and insurance premiums to provide for future income.

To compensate, European and UK institutions locked in long interest rates with derivative contracts, or interest-rate swaps, that receive a long-term interest rate while paying a short-term interest rate. Swaps are a leveraged position that requires collateral worth a fraction of the notional amount of the contract.

When the Fed jacked up interest rates in late 2021, the value of interest rate swaps that pay fixed and receive floating imploded. Pension funds and insurers were stuck with the equivalent of a ten-to-one margin position in long government bonds. The price of long government bonds fell by nearly 20% across the Group of Seven countries, and the value of derivatives contracts evaporated.

That left the institutions with margin calls that they could meet only by liquidating assets. That in turn led to a run on the UK government bond market, followed closely by the rest of European bond markets. The Bank of England‚Äôs emergency bond-buying delayed a market crash, but the UK gilts market remains on a knife edge, with option hedging costs at an all-time high.

A portfolio manager at one of Germany‚Äôs largest insurance companies said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a global margin call. I hope we survive.‚Äù

Weaker European banks may have trouble finding short-term funding. The cost of credit default swaps that insure 5-year bonds of Credit Suisse is now higher than it was in 2008, at nearly 400 basis points (4 percentage points) above the cost of interbank funding.

The venerable Swiss institution is a special case, with a series of losses due to poor risk controls. Credit Suisse probably will survive ‚Äì bank regulators will force it to sell assets and shrink ‚Äì but it will also call in collateral from customers.

American pension funds and insurers haven‚Äôt faced the same kind of margin calls, but they stand to suffer painful losses. As interest rates fell, they shifted to real income-earning assets like commercial real estate. The value of commercial real estate investment companies on the US stock market has fallen by 35%, about the same amount as the tech-heavy NASDAQ Index.

If that‚Äôs any indication, the $20 trillion value of the commercial real estate market has lost about $7 trillion this year, in addition to losses of nearly 20% on corporate bond and stock portfolios.

Stocks and bonds, the largest components of pension portfolios, are down about 20% during 2022.

European stocks are down 30% in dollar terms, and Japanese stocks are down by 25%. The publicly traded stock of private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR has lost 35% during 2022 to date.

All in ‚Äì depending on which survey of pension fund asset allocation you believe ‚Äì the average US pension has probably lost more than 20% of its asset value this year.

The Fed-driven asset bubble of the past ten years brought US pension funds up to minimum funding requirements to meet liabilities as of 2021. Now the Fed may take it all away again, and the biggest problem for major US corporations may be unfunded pension fund liabilities.

532,VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY," Why does volatility increase if liquidity decreases? 

As you know by now, the Fed is reducing liquidity on the market by raising interest rates and reducing the balance sheet and denying many people and businesses access to credit. An important component of volatility is the market cap. For example, if a company has a market cap of 100M, the movement of 50M is sufficient to significantly increase or decrease the stock. If, on the other hand, we want to move the price of a company with 1000 billion market caps, 500 billion will be needed to generate the same movement.

 You can therefore pump companies like [$GME (GameStop Corp.)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/gme) but not like [$AAPL (Apple)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/aapl) 

The companies' market caps have shrunk dramatically this year. 

This means that far less money is needed to move the major indices both down and up. 

In fact, it is much more frequent to see collapses and rises of more than 3% in a single day.

 In the chart below ([$SPX500](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/spx500) daily) you can see the difference between 2021 and 2022. Look at the size of the candles and the fluctuations of 2022 compared to those of 2021.

 Really watching the Dollar index  closely this week. We've held support  nicely around 111.00 and the  hawkish tones from NFP on Friday gave us  the extension bulls were  looking for.

From here 113 is an important barrier. The bulls need to clear it sometime this week to prove the rally still holds water.

Could   anything stop the dollar? Well, yes I think so. CPI is the main draw  of  the week on Thursday. If we see a lower print - something meaningful   that proves the interest rate hikes are working then it could be what   the market needs to reverse course. If that doesn't happen I suspect we   will be knocking on the 115 door sooner rather than later.

544,DD: Why I am long on Intel,"By revenue, Intel is the world‚Äôs leading semiconductor chip manufacturer. Recently, I have been doing a deep dive on this company because I work for a general contractor that is capable of constructing their facilities. I began this deep dive after learning about the [CHIPs Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/),and what market sectors are able to benefit from the government money that is out there. As a sum up, Biden agreed to put out $150B of gov money toward the domestic production of semiconductors and Intel, amongst a couple others, were one of the first to apply.

As I looked into Intel‚Äôs growth plan, I had found the fundamentals that had convinced me to begin DCAing into the stock (Yes I am long Intel, not a bag holder, first purchase was 9/19 and have avg price of 27.39 with only $168 invested bc of DCA, which i will continue to do). Since the CHIPs Act was introduced in 2021, Intel has vowed to increase production by 50% before 2025. Intel has already found a development group (Brookefield Infrastructure) to help them fund and build their next two facilities, which one in Ohio just had its ground breaking on 9/10 with Biden in attendance. 

On top of the solid fundamentals, and the fact that they are considered the worlds largest semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue, Intel is YTD -52.87% and hitting 52wk lows. Going along the lines of fearful when greedy and greedy when fearful, this company has the fundamentals and government backing to survive recession. Therefore, this stock is at a huge discount and will be a big ticket winner in the coming years. All that with a 5.37% dividend yield per NASDAQ.com and you have a solid long position.

To be clear, this is not financial advice. I have a $168 position in Intel that began 9/19 after researching the fundamentals of the company. I do not care if you buy or do not buy because neither will affect my position. I will be DCA every market day until next bull market. 

If you disagree with Intel, I will acknowledge that there are other companies taking advantage of the CHIPs Act, such as Qualcomm, Micron, and even Taiwan Semiconductors is trying to build in Phoenix to take advantage of the gov money. 

TLDR: Intel is using daddy‚Äôs money to increase production by 50% before 2023. The stock is at a 52% discount rn while two new facilities are produced.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe G7 is to sanction anyone who does not respect the cap by imposing a ban on receiving financing and insurance coverage. In fact, the G7 countries hold 90% of the world's corporate insurance market The problem is that to impose the price cap all 27 countries of the European Union must agree and it will be difficult to convince countries like Hungary and Slovakia which depend almost entirely on Russia and therefore have no alternatives.

561,$PSFE To Benefit From This Negative $PYPL News?,"Full Disclosure: I am long $PSFE warrants and options.  


[PayPal announced it would fine users $2,500 for misinformation and tried to backtrack its comments.](https://fortune.com/2022/10/10/paypal-users-fine-misinformation-aup-error-confusion/)However, it seems as if the damage has been done, as many users are flocked away from the platform to other payment solutions. PayPal is already beaten down, and I think this bit of news can send the stock lower.  


This hefty fine starts on November 3rd, and the company called it a confusion and it was just an error. However, in the age of social media, people don't trust PayPal anymore because who's to say they won't just draw the money from people even for the slightest spread of ""misinformation"" if they don't know it's misinformation (this happens sometimes). In the tech world, users matter and if users aren't active, this can significantly harm PayPal. Even Elon Musk commented on [David Marcus' tweet.](https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1578795041719750663?s=20&t=a-TwkiILSN2UU1h8IbElbA)  


PaySafe ($PSFE) can benefit from this as many influencers, users, journalists, etc. are already looking for new payment solutions, and I believe PaySafe ($PSFE) can be one of them. Now, PaySafe was a SPAC, and they're risky -- however, at these levels, I believe PaySafe can catch a massive bounce and build momentum. The risk-reward for PaySafe makes much more sense to me and trying to catch a falling knife on PayPal.  


$PSFE had an annualized transaction volume of more than $120B in 2021, and it's been around for a long time now, and although it's struggling to grow its revenues, if even just a small percentage of PayPal's users flock to PaySafe, it could be a welcomed surprise for the stock to explode.  


According to PaySafe, it has a Serviceable Available Market (SAM) of $70B. [In its Q2 earnings report](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_115deb4c3e1b4357786f55daf8f1dd7b/paysafe/db/1086/9828/pdf/Paysafe_Earnings+Presentation_vFinal.pdf), the company's Americas region grew by 18% YTD at the time. Top accounts growth (merchants generating more than $100K in revenue) grew by more than 10% in 2021. Its M&A growth was north of 30% YTD at the time (they define this as a user who interacted with the platform, specifically eCash and digital wallet).  


Most recently, $PSFE started its expansion into Kansas' online sports betting space, continuing its North American expansion plans. With this recent expansion, $PSFE operates in 23 states / jurisdictions. Its also in the New York region. It has partnerships with DraftKings ($DKNG) and Caesars Entertainment ($CZR).  


The one thing I don't like about the stock is the number of shares outstanding and floating. It has more than 500M shares floating, and about 4% of those are short. For me, this is a longer-term play, but I think in the short-term in can catch a pop off this $PYPL news.",y0dhli,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0dhli/psfe_to_benefit_from_this_negative_pypl_news/

Curious if anyone has any thoughts on this approach versus full electric. Plus, on the company I'm investing in, I don't understand how price keeps going down (especially after earnings calls that, at least to me, seem like positive news).

US-based companies announced plans to cut 29,989 jobs from their payrolls in September of 2022, the most in three months, and compared to 20,485 cuts in August as hiring is slowing and downsizing events are beginning to occur. The reading is also 67.6% higher than the 17,898 cuts announced a year earlier. Retailers cut the most jobs (9,273), followed by technology companies (4,212). Meanwhile, employers announced plans to hire 380,014 workers, the lowest September total since 2011, suggesting companies that typically staff seasonal hires are waiting to see whether consumers will show up for the holiday season. Considering Q3, job cuts fell by 1.6% from Q2 to 76,284 but went up 45.1% from a year earlier. So far this year however, employers announced plans to cut 209,495 jobs, the lowest January-September reading on record, and down 21% from the first nine months of 2021. The auto sector leads all industries in job cuts this year with 28,922. source: Challenger, Gray and Christmas, Inc.

US-based companies announced plans to cut 25,810 jobs from their payrolls in July of 2022, a 36.3% increase from the 18,942 cuts announced in July of 2021. The figure marks the second-highest amount of job cuts in the year so far, easing from the 16-month high of 32,517 in June. The automotive sector shed 9,510 jobs in July, while the technology sector cut 3,558 positions and financial firms cut 1,327 jobs. Still, the Challenger report noted that the labor market remains tight and that larger-scale layoffs have not yet started, despite indications that hiring activity is slowing after an extended period of growth.So far this year, employers announced plans to cut 159,021 jobs from their payrolls, a 31.3% drop from the corresponding period of the previous year.

US-based companies announced plans to cut 32,517 jobs from their payrolls in June of 2022, the highest reading since February last year, and a 58.8% increase from the 20,476 cuts announced in the same month last year. The Automotive sector announced the most cuts with 10,198, amid supply chain issues, semiconductor shortages, surging gas prices, and increased demand for electric vehicles. Considering Q2, employers announced 77,515 job cuts, the highest quarterly total since Q1 2021. ‚ÄúEmployers are beginning to respond to financial pressures and slowing demand by cutting costs.

575,Why the smartest play might be just buying Google Stock.,"""The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.""
-Warren Buffett, Fortune, 1999

I‚Äôve come to the realization that buying $GOOG is the smartest decision an investor can make. I‚Äôve opened a new portfolio, where I will be setting aside 1/3 of my monthly income and buying Google shares, and nothing else.

I don‚Äôt need to tell you how dominate Google is with search, Microsoft tried to take a run at google with Bing a decade ago, they spent 20 Billion, and failed. The MOAT google has on search is astounding. They make 300 million dollars a day off search alone. ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù has become a synonym for ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù

That‚Äôs not even including YouTube, Chrome, Android ect ect. Every kid at my local school district is given a Chromebook.

And if I had to place a bet on which company will dominate AI services in the future, it would be google. I regularly use the Google lens AI to find out what plant/tree/insect/item, literally anything, just take a photo of it and it will tell you what it is. It‚Äôs incredible and extraordinarily useful.

I just took a picture of one of my X-rays, I know what the radiologist assessment is already, but the app doesn‚Äôt. It pulled up images of similar x rays with the same diagnosis. Think of that, the AI is already able to replace jobs in the medical field. Find a similar case, and show the course of action needed. Incredible.

I think this is the stock of the 21st century, this is like buying Tobacco stocks in 1902, you‚Äôll make a fortune, the fallacy is ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late‚Äù no, the train will keep chugging along, you just watch.",y0481a,19,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y0481a/why_the_smartest_play_might_be_just_buying_google/
576,"Who knew that UK pension funds are worse than WSB? Nearly half of them received margin calls, with margin debts exceeding $100 Billion. Fund retirements the YOLO way with up-to 7:1 leverage.","The financial system is levered af. Even ""conservative"" pension funds rely on margin to increase returns. Supposedly this is acceptable since government bonds are risk-free. So loading up on UK government bonds with margin debt seems like a no brainer until it becomes another Long-Term Capital Management moment waiting for a central bank to bail them out.

End of September nearly half of UK pension funds were reported to have received margin calls of up to  ¬£100 million each requiring a total of over  ¬£ 100 billion additional margin collateral.

One report found that pension schemes could borrow up to  7 pounds for 1 pound invested. 7:1 leverage. YOLO.

585,PUT/CALL RATIO IN DOWNTREND," The options market is a fundamental component of any asset. Think of options as some kind of insurance. If you buy a call, you pay a premium to secure the right to buy 100 shares at a certain price by the deadline. Conversely, if you buy a put you are assured the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price by the deadline. The put / call ratio represents investor sentiment. If above 1 it means that there are more puts than calls and the sentiment is bearish while a put / call ratio below 1 means that there are more calls than puts and the sentiment is bullish. The graph below shows the trend of the put / call ratio over the last six months on the [$SPX500](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/spx500) . We can see that it is in sharp decline compared to the past few weeks. However, the market needs good news and Thursday's inflation data will be key to a possible restart or to see new lows.

But in 25 states and territories, incomes are increasing. The following 10 states had the highest percentage gains:

&#x200B;

Vermont: 8.5%

New Hampshire: 7.1%

Arizona: 5%

South Dakota: 4.8%

Montana: 4.4%

Maine: 3.7%

Idaho: 2.8%

Indiana: 2.8%

Pennsylvania: 2.5%

North Carolina: 2%

Vermont is first overall, with median household income rising from $66,766 to $72,431 in 2021. D.C. fared worst of all places, with median income dropping by 7.9% ‚Äî from $97,781 to $90,088.

&#x200B;

The Census Bureau‚Äôs report doesn‚Äôt suggest why certain states fared better than others. However, income growth could be partly related to pandemic migration patterns away from urban centers in states like California and New York.

&#x200B;

Aside from Pennsylvania, states with the most income growth also experienced some of the highest rates of population inflow in 2021, according to Pew Research Center data.

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs worth remember that income varies widely depending on where you live. For instance, Maryland had a 2021 median household income of $90,203, which is nearly double that of lowest-ranked Mississippi, where median household income is $48,716.

&#x200B;

There are only two places ‚Äî Maryland and D.C. ‚Äî where median household income is over $90,000. Massachusetts and New Jersey had median household income above $90,000 in 2019, but it dropped to just below that threshold in 2021.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 
* Bond markets are closed, and it's a bank holiday. So expect reduction in liquidity as well as more volatile prices. A good opportunity to get into underpriced positions. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",xzz4ev,10,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xzz4ev/20221010_better_tasting_crayons_mathematically/
